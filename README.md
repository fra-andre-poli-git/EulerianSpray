# EulerianSpray
This is the repository of my APSC/PACS project on Eulerian Sprays.

The licensing is in according to what I read on deal.ii readme https://www.dealii.org/9.5.0/readme.html#license

Probably I will use the installation of deal.ii in the mk modules https://github.com/pcafrica/mk

To make it run with mk modules I have to understand better how does CMake work.
For the moment should be sufficient to do
cmake .
make
make run
In my machine runs it with the independent installation of version 9.5.0
